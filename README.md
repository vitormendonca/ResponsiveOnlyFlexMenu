# ResponsiveOnlyFlexMenu
Simple and Complete "Hamburguer" Menu. On javascript I made a simple Hide/Show with the icon, adding a new row or removing when navigation is hidden. All css is display Flex default. Only used inline-block on Tag to make it the size of the
Tag for smalldevices. As I am a beginner, the code can be improved.
